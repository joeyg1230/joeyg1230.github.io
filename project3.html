 <p> For this project it was a bit difficult for me trying to figure out MeshMixer and Sketch Fab. I think one of the biggest problems i was having was trying to figure out how to place my object which was difficult because i didn't have a mouse to use. I started off this project really just messing around with images from google Poly and I ended up finding the snake which i tried to transform as much as possible. By transforming the snake I was able to get an idea of a desert scenery with a the snake coming from the ground.
Once i got the idea going I was able to make some sort of funky cacti with the hand objects and sculpt out spikes with the sculpting tools. Once I exported my model to Sketchfab I was able to create all the effects i wanted to. Giving the user an effect like they were stranded in the desert. One of the effects that i felt worked the best with what i was trying to portray was the depth of field view. With the depth of field effect it gave my model a mirage feeling where it seems like you're trapped in the desert with with this snake.</p>
