    I created this video to resemble the influence technology has on society. I created a story line of how technology can have a negative effect on a person with it taking over one's life and becoming that person's life. I wanted to use the monkeys as the main characters in my story because i feel like in science monkeys are always the testers of experiments. This video shows how the monkeys interaction with technology took over their brain and eventually turned the monkeys into robot monkeys then to actually becoming the technology. I feel like the meaning i have behind the piece is that technology isn't always the best thing to be attached to.
